    ## About this API


    The **Miele 3rd Party API** lets you remotely access connected Miele home
    appliances via the cloud.  

    To use it, you’ll need:


    - A valid Miele user account  

    - Miele@home-enabled appliances linked to that account  


    The API gives you access to appliance status and lets you trigger basic
    actions.  

    Note: Available features may vary depending on the appliance type and
    generation.

      Learn more about the Miele@home system [here](https://www.miele.com).

    ## Important Notes


    ### New Generation Devices


    Endpoints for the **new generation washers/dryers** and **vacuum cleaners**
    are not yet fully available.  

    They’re expected to be released in **Fall 2025**.

    ## Terms of Use


    By using the API, you agree to the  **Miele 3rd Party API License and Terms
    of Use**.

    ## Access & Authorization


    ### Get Access


    Generate your personal developer credentials here:  

    [https://developer.miele.com](https://developer.miele.com/get-involved)

        
    ### Authorization Flow


    The API uses **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow**.  

    For details, check out:


    - [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.txt)  

    - [OAuth.net](https://oauth.net/2/)



    **Starting with API V1.1.0, Miele supports an additional OAuth2 Provider
    that can be used to issue tokens with device-specific permissions.** 


    The new Miele OAuth2 Provider supports the following endpoints and **should
    be used for your developments**.

    **The legacy OAuth provider with the following endpoints is still active for
    now:**


    - **Auth URL:**  `https://api.mcs3.miele.com/thirdparty/login`

    - **Token URL:** `https://api.mcs3.miele.com/thirdparty/token`


    However, it will be phased out in the future and **shouldn't be used for new
    developments**. </br> Please adapt        your implementation for use of the
    new OAuth provider in the near future.

    development.
